The aim of this is to determine how usable and helpful this web app is for teaching people about Pi Calculus and the encoding from session types to linear types. To do this, we need to show it to people and see how much it helped them understand those concepts. The survey starts with a few questions to work out how much you know already, then gives you a few tasks to complete on the web app and finally asks you some questions on how you felt about it. We're only recording your answers to the questions, not your performance in the tasks, so don't worry about how you do in those. Feel free to ask questions and let me know when you're done, and you can withdraw at any point. Do you agree to take part? And do you have any questions before starting?
