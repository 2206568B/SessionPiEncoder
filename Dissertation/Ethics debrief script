Like I said before starting, the aim of this survey was to determine how usable and helpful this web app is in teaching people about pi calculus and the encoding from session types to linear types. Do you have any questions about any aspects of the survey? My email, and my supervisor's email are both on the form, so if you have any questions, you can reach us through those. Thank you for helping.
